# How to Optimize a CUDA Matmul Kernel for cuBLAS-like Performance

<details>
  <summary>CuBLAS</summary>
  CuBLAS is a CUDA library for linear algebra operations. It provides GPU-accelerated BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) functions.

  ## What is CuBLAS?
  CuBLAS is a CUDA library for linear algebra operations. It provides GPU-accelerated BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) functions.

  ## Why CuBLAS?
  CuBLAS is used for:

  * Accelerating linear algebra operations on NVIDIA GPUs
  * Providing a set of GPU-accelerated BLAS functions
  * Improving performance and efficiency in linear algebra computations

  ## CuBLAS Functions
  CuBLAS provides various functions for:

  * Matrix-vector operations (e.g., matrix-vector multiplication)
  * Matrix-matrix operations (e.g., matrix-matrix multiplication)
  * Vector operations (e.g., dot product, norm)
  * Matrix factorizations (e.g., LU, Cholesky)

  ## How CuBLAS Works
  To use the cuBLAS API, the application must allocate the required matrices and vectors in the GPU memory space, fill them with data, call the sequence of desired cuBLAS functions, and then upload the results from the GPU memory space back to the host. The cuBLAS API also provides helper functions for writing and retrieving data from the GPU.

  * CuBLAS uses CUDA kernels to execute linear algebra operations on the GPU
  * The library provides a set of APIs for developers to access the GPU-accelerated BLAS functions
  * CuBLAS handles memory management, data transfer, and thread organization for the user

  ## Benefits of CuBLAS

  * Faster execution times compared to CPU-based BLAS implementations
  * Reduced power consumption due to GPU acceleration
  * Simplified development process with easy-to-use APIs
